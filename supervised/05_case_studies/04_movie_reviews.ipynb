              " b\"good films are hard to find these days . \\ngreat films are beyond rare . \\nproof of life , russell crowe's one-two punch of a deft kidnap and rescue thriller , is one of those rare gems . \\na taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting , an intelligent script , and masterful directing , together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these days , genuine motivation in a story that rings true . \\nconsider the strange coincidence of russell crowe's character in proof of life making the moves on a distraught wife played by meg ryan's character in the film -- all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world . \\ni haven't seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah's masterpiece , the getaway . \\nbut enough with the gossip , let's get to the review . \\nthe film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman ( david morse ) , an american engineer working in south america who is kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by anti-government soldiers . \\nupon discovering his identity , the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for $6 million . \\nthe only problem is that the company peter bowman works for is being auctioned off , and no one will step forward with the money . \\nwith no choice available to her , bowman's wife alice ( ryan ) hires terry thorne ( crowe ) , a highly skilled negotiator and rescue operative , to arrange the return of her husband . \\nbut when things go wrong -- as they always do in these situations -- terry and his team ( which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year : david caruso ) take matters into their own hands . \\nthe film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and creates a complex and intelligent character-driven vehicle filled with well-written dialogue , shades of motivation , and convincing acting by all the actors . \\nthe script is based on both a book ( the long march to freedom ) and a magazine article pertaining to kidnap/ransom situations , and the story has been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy , screenwriter of the devil's advocate and dolores claiborne . \\nthe biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe and ryan , but that between crowe and david caruso . \\ndug out from b-movie hell , caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as crowe's right hand gun while providing most of the film's humor . \\nryan cries a lot and smokes too many cigarettes , david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp to hate him , and crowe provides another memorable acting turn as the stoic , gunslinger character of terry thorne . \\nthe most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes . \\nthe bulk of those scenes , which bookend the movie , work extremely well as establishment and closure devices for all of the story's characters . \\nthe scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and poise . \\ndirector taylor hackford mixes both his old-school style of filmmaking with the dizziness of a lars von trier film . \\nproof of life is a thinking man's action movie . \\nit is a film about the choices men and women make in the face of love and war , and the sacrifices one makes for those choices -- the sacrifices that help you sleep at night . \\n\",\n",
              " b\"quaid stars as a man who has taken up the proffesion of dragonslayer after he feels he is betrayed by a dragon early in the movie . \\nhe runs into the last dragon in existence , and there is a genuinely amusing battle between the two which results in a standoff where quaid is in the dragons mouth , but has his sword pointed at the dragons brain . \\neventually , they decide to call a truce , and they work out a deal . \\nsince he is the last dragon , he will pretend to die and quaid will be able to get paid for it . \\ntheir scam works at first , until they come to a town without any money . \\ninstead the town sacrifices a girl to the dragon , but of course , draco is a nice droagon , so he won't eat her . there is however a very amusing scene where draco is hitting on the young girl . \\nof course , as you can probably tell by the plot , this is a silly movie , but it does know when to take itself seriously at the right times , unlike eddie , which was serious all the time . \\nyou could probably call this a medieval comedy , because there are more laughs here than in eddie and spy hard combined . \\ndennis quaid makes a fine hero . \\npete posthlewaite provides some ghreat comedy as a monk who journeys with them . \\ndina meyer is appealing as the sacrificed girl . \\nbut lets face it , the movie is really about the dragon , and what an amazing creation he is . \\nconnery's voice and ilm team up to provide us with a truly magnificent dragon . \\nso , if you are going to see this movie for a strong hard core medieval epic , you are going to the wrong movie . \\nif you are going because of the dragon , you will not be dissapointed , and you will be provided with plenty of laughs that smooth out the boring parts in the script . \\n\",\n",

              " b'i don\\'t know how many other people have had the idea cross their mind that their life could be an ongoing television show watched by another world of people , but it\\'s something i used to wonder about when i was younger . \\ni can\\'t decide if i first thought it because i watched a lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with a baseball bat , but i\\'m pretty sure andrew niccol , screenwriter for the truman show , has had the same curious thought . \\nthe truman show is about a man ( jim carrey ) whose entire life has been engineered by a corporation and marketed to the public . \\nsince birth , he\\'s been living in the fictional island town of seahaven , fla . , which actually exists as a giant domed set just beyond the hollywood sign . \\nall the people in truman burbank\\'s life are actors , and the anonymous townfolk paid extras . \\npeople watch truman\\'s life 24 hours a day , live , with no commercial interruptions . \\nrevenue comes instead from product placement , a staple of contemporary hollywood , with truman\\'s friends and relatives describing their consumer items in cheerful and optimistic tones . \\nthe sun rises and sets on cue and everyone likes everyone else . \\neven if you haven\\'t seen the truman show , you\\'ve probably learned most of the crucial details from the commercials , the trailer and other promotion blitzes . \\nif anything i\\'ve written so far is a surprise to you , then i pity you for making me a primary source for your entertainment news . \\neither way , you should probably know the premise of the truman show going into it , because otherwise you\\'ll probably think it sucks . \\nit begins with jim carrey looking into a mirror , reciting the crucial \" eat me \" scene from alive , wishing his neighbors a good day , afternoon and evening , and living in domestic bliss with his wife ( laura linney ) . \\nbut weird things start happening . \\na stage light comes falling out of the sky , truman hears people tracking his movements on the radio and he swears he sees his dead father . \\nwe learn through a flashback that his father drowned when truman was a child , sailing through a rainstorm . \\nthe death was staged by director christof ( ed harris ) , who wanted to put a fear of water into truman to keep him from leaving the island . \\nsimilar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling upon the truth , not the least of them truman\\'s best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) , who assures him he\\'s not in on any conspiracy because the last thing he\\'d ever do is hurt him . \\nas truman\\'s trusting eyes tear over , christof fades up emotional synthesizer music for a worldwide audience of people who apparently never watch anything else . \\nthere\\'s even a daily behind-the-scenes update from harry shearer that captures the highlights of truman\\'s existence . \\nthe key to a movie like this is in finding the right balance between humor and drama , because a premise like this has its obvious implications in both directions . \\nand it all hinges on carrey , who has to balance comic naivet with a real sense of longing and drive to find out what the hell is going on . \\nhe\\'s come a long way from talking butt cheeks in ace ventura . \\nmost fundamentally , it\\'s just plain interesting to follow along as director peter weir shows us just how they can capture a person\\'s life without the person realizing it -- how they coordinate extras , hide cameras and feed automatic lines to actors . \\nthe most interesting thing about the truman show is that most of us can probably imagine some ambitious director pitching a show like this . \\nsure , the most interesting tv genre of the \\'90s has been reality programming and jerry springer\\'s popularity is through the roof , but those people deserve to be humiliated for turning their intimate details over to the airwaves . \\nand when news shows use hidden cameras , it\\'s done in the name of the greater good , not entertainment . \\nbut merge the two and you\\'ve got the truman show . \\nright now , it\\'s implausible -- i mean , the fcc won\\'t let you say the s-word on the air ; do you think they\\'d let you broadcast every detail of a man\\'s life to the entire world without his consent ? \\none day , though , it could happen . \\nand , even though it would mean the end of privacy , people would eat it up . \\nyou know they would . \\n',\n",

              " b'gothic murder-mystery yarns are not a new conceit . \\nin fact , they\\'ve been around in books and on film for many , many years . \\nwithout the proper handling , they come off as old-fashioned , bland , and outdated . \\n \" the gift , \" directed by sam raimi , is a tried-and-true effort that surprises very little , and includes everything from a wide array of suspects and red herrings , to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front , to the eventual discovery of a waterlogged corpse found in a nearby pond . \\nit\\'s fairly obvious who the killer is ; in fact , i predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions . \\nthe film ultimately shouldn\\'t work , but it does , thanks to a sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances , the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other . \\nannie wilson ( cate blanchett ) is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown . \\nsome of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale ( hilary swank ) , who is severely abused by her husband donnie ( keanu reeves ) , and buddy cole ( giovanni ribisi ) , an unstable mechanic who is confused by the nightmares he\\'s been having about a mysterious blue diamond that is somehow linked to his father . \\nfor annie , she does not give the readings merely for money , but uses it as a way of seeking solace in finding the good in everyone\\'s future . \\nher late grandmother ( rosemary harris ) told her as a child that it was a gift she was given , and she should always remember that . \\nwhen annie\\'s eldest son is involved in a fight at school , she meets the nice-guy school principal , wayne collins ( greg kinnear ) , whom she finds herself attracted to . \\nbut wayne is engaged to the wealthy jessica king ( katie holmes ) , whom annie immediately gets a negative vibe about . \\nat a party with her best friend linda ( kim dickens ) , annie stumbles upon jessica in a compromising position with lawyer david duncan ( gary cole ) . \\nsoon after , jessica has disappeared , leaving everyone in a frenzy over what could have possibly happened to her , and annie starts to have nightmares and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale , and the pond behind his home . \\n \" the gift \" may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level , but the performances and tight direction from raimi ( who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film , 1999\\'s \" for love of the game \" ) lift the picture up several notches . \\nslowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters and their individual plights , the disappearance of jessica at the 30-minute mark divulges the movie\\'s true intentions and transforms the proceedings into a taut , at times frightening , horror-mystery . \\nat the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett ( 1999\\'s \" the talented mr . ripley \" ) , who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than a run-of-the-mill protagonist into a very exact , down-to-earth , realistic person with valid troubles and a caring attitude towards those around her . \\nblanchett takes the unextraordinary material and runs with it , giving the entire film a truly classy aura that it otherwise might not have had . \\nwe follow her at every turn because she is so mesmerizing , both as a character and an actress . \\nblanchett isn\\'t the only bright performer , as she is ably supported by one of the best casts of the year . \\nin her first role following her oscar win for 1999\\'s \" boys don\\'t cry , \" hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie , who seeks guidance from annie , but is too scared to take her biggest advice of all : to leave the grossly abusive donnie . \\nas donnie , keanu reeves ( 2000\\'s \" the watcher \" ) makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie , so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all . \\nfor the often-criticized reeves , whose acting abilities have never been the best , this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get , and it is also one of the better performances he has given . \\ngiovanni ribisi ( 2000\\'s \" the boiler room \" ) is heartbreaking as a mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend , and wants her to do nothing but help him understand why he is being plagued by bad dreams about his dad . \\nin the small , but pivotal role of the sleazy jessica king , katie holmes ( 2000\\'s \" wonder boys \" ) has turned in yet another stunning supporting turn . \\nher promiscuous role of jessica is one she has never played before , and she is radiant in her few scenes . \\nfinally , kim dickens ( 2000\\'s \" hollow man \" ) makes her usual strong impression as annie\\'s spicy best friend , linda . \\nthe other notable aspect of \" the gift \" is its moody atmosphere that lays such a thickly foreboding air over every scene it\\'s almost suffocating . \\nthanks to cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn and bob murawski , and the successful use of different eerie sounds effects and a very good music score by christopher young , the movie not only achieves a scary undercurrent , but one that is filled with dread . \\nhelped along by a strong screenplay by billy bob thornton and tom epperson , which makes the most of its setting and delightful cast , \" the gift \" is that rarest of thrillers that actually thrills , and offers up a fair share of chills , too . \\nit may not be groundbreakingly original , but it sure is an entertaining ride for the duration of its running time . \\n',\n",
              " b\"what i look for in a movie is not necessarily perfection . \\nsometimes a movie has such strong ideas that despite whatever flaws it may have , i will prefer it to a better-made film that is not as thought-provoking . \\nthe thin red line is flawed but it provokes . \\nterence malick returns to filmmaking 20 years after days of heaven and produces this meditative look at war . \\nunlike this year's saving private ryan , which dwells on war as a necessary evil and explores the moral ambiguities thereof , the thin red line simply says war is waste . \\nwhile that might seem obvious to some , only after experiencing the film do you realize how profound a waste it is . \\nsaving private ryan has an underlying and practical acceptance that war will occur and it has a great cost ; the thin red line says idealistically avoid this at all costs . \\none message is not necessarily more correct than the other . \\nit just depends on one's point of view . \\nin malick's film , war is set in a tropical paradise , and john toll's cinematography is beyond lush . \\nthe setting poses the question , why are we fighting in the face of such beauty ? \\nin saving private ryan , the capture of a german soldier presents the moral quandary of whether to let him go . \\nin the thin red line , the japanese present the moral quandary of war in the first place . \\nthey are just like the americans -- frightened and angry , grieving and praying . \\nall that separates them is war . \\nthe flaw in the thin red line comes in the voice-overs . \\nunbelievable as coming from the characters and sometimes pretentious , sometimes corny , the voice-overs tell us what the images before us already do and are completely unnecessary . \\ndispensing with them , malick could have achieved a tarkovskian grandeur . \\ninstead , he gets distracting self-consciousness . \\naside from that , malick's direction is stunning . \\nthe tracking shots across windswept hills and around transports speeding toward shore are extraordinary . \\nsean penn , elias koteas , and nick nolte give the best performances . \\npenn is subtle as a sergeant trying to hide his humanism , koteas is genuine as a compassionate captain , and nolte startling as a colonel whose blood vessels are about to burst if he cannot win his battle . \\njohn travolta and george clooney are the worst in cameo roles . \\nultimately however , the thin red line's interest is not in the characters and it is not in drama . \\nit has been frequently criticized for its lack of dramatic structure , but malick clearly has different things on his mind . \\nhas no one ever thought that getting dramatic entertainment from war is exploitative ? \\nwhat malick is working with is theme , and in that , the thin red line is most provoking . \\n\",\n",
